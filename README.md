# Design-and-Implementation-of-a-Memory-Management-Simulator
1. Overview 

Memory management is a fundamental responsibility of an operating system, involving the 
allocation, deallocation, caching, and virtualization of memory resources. This project 
focuses on implementing a memory management simulator that models how an OS 
manages physical and virtual memory. 

The simulator will support multiple dynamic memory allocation strategies, simulate 
multilevel CPU caches, and implement virtual memory using paging. The goal is not to 
build a real OS kernel, but to accurately model and simulate OS memory-management 
behavior using well-defined data structures and algorithms. 
This project emphasizes algorithmic correctness, performance trade-offs, and systems
level design. 

2. Objectives 

The primary objectives of the project are: 

• To understand dynamic memory allocation strategies and fragmentation. 

• To simulate memory allocation and deallocation at runtime. 

• To implement and compare cache replacement policies. 

• To model virtual memory using paging and address translation. 

• To gain hands-on experience with OS-level abstractions using user-space code.
